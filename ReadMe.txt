//Calculate the area of a triangle

//The area of a triangle is equal to 1/2 base time height. A = 1/2bh

//Write a program that accepts values for base and height and prints the area


//The value of the base is equal to 14.5 m
//The value of the height should be equal 6.99 m

//HINT: the number 5 is what data type? The number 5.0 is what data type? What is 1/5 in java?
